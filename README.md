## Introduction
This project aims to design and implement a relational database system for managing **Netflix content creators** and their related data. The system includes entities such as content creators, agents, contracts, productions, awards, and user feedback.  
The goal is to apply database design principles (up to 3NF), execute SQL operations, and demonstrate multi-method data insertion.

    _Final state of the `Agent` table confirming that the deleted records were permanently removed._


### constraints
**_This stage was critical to maintaining database reliability by enforcing data validity rules and preventing inconsistent entries._**  
  In this stage, several constraints were added to ensure data integrity and consistency within the database. Initially, SELECT queries were executed to identify any existing records that violated the intended constraints. Where necessary, these records were updated with default or corrected values to maintain data validity before the constraints were enforced.

The implemented constraints include:

- **Check constraint on `Feedback.FeedbackRating`** — values are restricted between 1 and 10; invalid ratings were updated to the default value of 5.0.
- **Default value for `Feedback.FeedbackDate`** — missing dates were set to the current date, and a default of `CURRENT_DATE` was established.
- **Positive payment constraint on `Contract.Payment`** — negative payment values were corrected to zero, and a check constraint was added to prevent negative values.
- **Date order constraint on `Contract`** — `EndDate` must be later than `StartDate`; invalid dates were adjusted to be 30 days after the start date.
- **Valid year range on `Award.AwardYear`** — values are limited between the year 1900 and the current date; invalid years were updated to the current date.
- **NOT NULL constraint on `Agent.Email`** — null email values were replaced with a default email before enforcing the constraint.
- **Check constraint on `Production.ProductionRating`** — ratings must be between 0 and 10; invalid ratings were updated to 5.0.
- **Default value for `Feedback.FeedbackRating`** — a default rating of 5.0 was set.

  All constraints were implemented via `ALTER TABLE` statements adding `CHECK`, `DEFAULT`, and `NOT NULL` constraints, following the correction of existing data where necessary to comply with the new       rules.

  For full details, [see thee Constraints SQL script](Stage2/Constraints/CheckAndFixConstraints.sql).

## Stage 3 – Integration and Views

### Introduction Stage 3
As part of the integration phase, we received a [database backup](Stage3/infrastructure_backup_for_reconstruction/infrastructure_backup_for_reconstruction) from another department in the project – the Infrastructure Department of Netflix.

Using reverse engineering, we reconstructed the [DSD schema](Stage3/ReconstructedDiagrams/ReconstructedDSDdiagram)  of the infrastructure department based on the provided backup. From that schema, we derived the corresponding [ERD](Stage3/ReconstructedDiagrams/ReconstructedERDdiagram)  to visualize the logical relationships within their system.

Next, we proceeded to merge the two departments' designs. This was done by analyzing both ERDs and identifying a logical connection point. 
During the integration process, we applied several structural modifications to ensure seamless alignment between the two databases:

*  **Removal of Unused Column:**
  The column `affectedusers` was dropped from the `ErrorLogs` table, as it was completely empty and had no relevance to our data model.

*  **Introduction of a Linking Entity – `ProductionDeployment`:**
  To logically connect the two domains (content production and infrastructure), we introduced a new table named `ProductionDeployment`. This table links the `Production` and `Servers` entities, representing deployments of specific content onto specific servers.
  The table was populated using structured CSV data, allowing for quick integration.
  *[ProductionDeployment CSV Data](Stage3/Integration/insertinsert_production_deployment_data.csv)*

*  **Populating Missing Foreign Key – `datacenterid` in `Servers`:**
  The `Servers` table initially lacked values for the foreign key `datacenterid`.
  We used a SQL script that randomly assigned valid IDs from the existing `Datacenters` table, ensuring relational integrity while simulating realistic deployment conditions.

All of these schema-level changes are implemented within the integration script:
*[Integration Script – ProductionDeployment](Stage3/Integration/integrate.sql)*


Based on this integrated model, we designed a new [ERD](Stage3/Integration/IntegrationDiagrams/ERDdiagram) and [DSD](Stage3/Integration/IntegrationDiagrams/DSDdiagram)  schema for the combined department, representing the full, unified structure of the joint system.

This integration process allowed us to design a coherent, unified data model while preserving the original logic and structure of both departments.

### Views


#### View 1  
_This view consolidates essential information about content creators and their work within the Netflix production system._      
_It integrates data from five key tables: `Content_Creator`, `Agent`, `Contract`, `Production`, and `Feedback`._  

_The view includes the creator's identity and agent, details about productions they were involved in (title, type, genre), their contractual role and payment, and feedback received from the audience. It enables both operational tracking and analytical insights into creator engagement and production impact._    

_This unified perspective supports querying by genre, evaluating performance by feedback rating, and understanding financial allocation across content types._

## Stage 4 - PL/pgSQL Programming  



### Main Programs   

- **Analyze High-Earning Active Creators & Delete Old Feedbacks**    
     _Identifies high-earning active content creators using a function, and deletes feedbacks older than 5 years using a procedure._  
      
     This main program performs two key operations:

   - Identification and analysis of high-earning active content creators –
     By calling the function `calculate_total_payments_for_active_creators()`, the program loops through and prints creators who are marked as active and have received a total payment exceeding a defined      threshold.
     
   -  Deletion of outdated feedback entries –
      The program then calls the procedure `delete_old_feedbacks_and_count()`, which deletes feedback records older than 5 years and returns the number of deleted rows. This helps in maintaining database       cleanliness and relevance.
      
     Throughout the execution, the program uses `RAISE NOTICE` statements to indicate progress and outcomes, and includes exception handling for unexpected errors.
  
    **Related Files:**
   -  [ProgramSource](Stage4/main_programs/prog1.sql)
   -  [Sample Output](Stage4/main_programs/prog1_output)<br> <br>

- **Update & Report Server Errors**    
     _Updates server statuses based on network conditions and displays a summary of high severity errors using a refcursor._  

     This main PL/pgSQL script performs two core action:  

   - Status Update: It begins by calling the stored procedure update_server_status_by_network, which evaluates the latest latency and packet loss statistics to update each
     server's operational status.
     
   -  Error Summary Report: Then, it calls the function get_server_error_summary, which returns a refcursor pointing to a result set of servers with high severity errors.
      The program loops through the cursor to print out each server's ID, location, and the number of critical errors detected.  
      
     The process is wrapped in a DO block with exception handling to ensure graceful error logging if unexpected failures occur during execution.

   -  [Sample Output](Stage4/main_programs/prog2_output)

   


### Functions    

- **calculate_total_payments_for_active_creators**  
     _Calculates the total payments made to all active content creators, using the contract and content_creator tables._  
      
    This PL/pgSQL function iterates over all active content creators (isactive = true) from the content_creator table and calculates the total payment made to each creator based on the contract table.
    It returns a result table with the following columns:
    creator_id – The ID of the content creator (content_creator.creatorid)  
    creator_name – The full name of the content creator (content_creator.content_creatorfullname)
    total_payment – The total sum of all payment values from the contract table, grouped by creatorid  
    Additional behaviors:  
    If the total payment for a creator exceeds 100,000, a NOTICE is displayed  
    If an error occurs while processing a specific creator, it is logged via NOTICE and processing continues with the next one  
    Each result row is returned using RETURN NEXT.

  - [Execution Screenshot](Stage4/Functions/calculate_total_payments_for_active_creators/image.png)    
  

- **get_server_error_summary**
     _Retrieves the number of high-severity errors per server using a REFCURSOR._   

This PL/pgSQL function provides a summary of high-severity errors (`severity = 'High'`) recorded for each server, by querying data from the `servers` and `errorlogs` tables      
  
Key behaviors of the function:     
 
    - Declares and opens a cursor named `error_summary_cursor`.
    - Executes a `SELECT` statement joining `servers` and `errorlogs`, filtering only high-severity errors, grouping by server ID and location, and counting the number of such errors per server.
    - Returns the opened REFCURSOR instead of a direct result set.

  - **Usage flow:**
      1. Start a transaction:  
         `BEGIN;`
      2. Call the function to retrieve the cursor:  
         `SELECT get_server_error_summary();`
      3. Fetch the result set from the cursor:  
         `FETCH ALL FROM error_summary_cursor;`
      4. End the transaction:  
         `COMMIT;`
   **Returned columns:**
       `serverid` – The server’s ID  
       `location` – The server’s physical location  
       `high_errors` – The number of high-severity errors found <br> <br>

### Procedures      

- **delete_old_feedbacks_and_count**    
     _Deletes feedback records older than 5 years from the feedback table and returns the number of rows deleted._  
      
   This PL/pgSQL procedure removes outdated feedback records by checking if their feedbackdate is older than 5 years from today. It then returns the number of deleted rows via an OUT parameter.    

   The procedure includes the following steps:

     - Declares a cutoff date (feedbacks_before) as the current date minus 5 years.

     - Deletes all records from the feedback table where feedbackdate is older than feedbacks_before.

     - Uses GET DIAGNOSTICS to capture the number of deleted rows into the deleted_count output parameter.

     - Displays a NOTICE message with the number of records deleted.

   *   [Execution Screenshot](Stage4/Procedures/delete_old_feedbacks_and_count/final_process_feed.png)<br> <br>
  

- **update_server_status_by_network**      
    _Updates the operational status of each server based on its most recent network usage data._    
      
   This PL/pgSQL procedure analyzes the most recent network performance data for each server and updates its status in the `servers`  table. It checks the latest
  `averagelatency` and `packetloss` values     from the `networkusage` table to determine whether a server should be marked as 'Active' or 'Maintenance'.
  
   Detailed behavior:

    - For each server, the procedure retrieves the latest record from the `networkusage` table using `DISTINCT ON (serverid)` ordered by timestamp descending.
      
    - It then evaluates the following conditions:

    - If `averagelatency` > 500 OR `packetloss` > 5, the server status is updated to `Maintenance`.

    - Otherwise, the server is marked as `Active`.

    - If an error occurs while updating a specific server, a `NOTICE` is raised and the procedure continues to the next server.

    - At the end of execution, a final `NOTICE` confirms that the update process has completed.

### Triggers  

 - **check_creator_active – Trigger to enforce active creator constraint**      
    _Ensures that a contract can only be inserted if the associated content creator is marked as active._    
      
    This trigger is defined on the `contract` table and uses the `check_creator_active()` function. Before any new contract is inserted, the trigger verifies whether
    the referenced `creatorid` belongs to an active content creator (`isactive = TRUE`).
    If the creator is not active or does not exist, the trigger raises an exception and blocks the insert operation. This ensures business rule enforcement and protects data consistency.
   
    The trigger function:  
     - Checks existence of the creator with `isactive = TRUE`

     - Raises a descriptive exception if the condition fails

     - Returns `NEW` to allow insert only if the creator is active

     * [Execution Screenshot](Stage4/Triggers/check_if_active_contentcreator/test_trigger1.png)<br> <br>


- **trg_log_server_deletion – Log server deletions automatically**      
    _logs every deletion from the `servers` table by inserting the deleted server's details into a dedicated audit table._    
      
   The `trg_log_server_deletion` trigger is bound to the `servers` table and activates **after a row is deleted**. It executes the `log_server_deletion()` function, which captures information about the      deleted server, including:

  - The server ID (`serverid`)
  - Its physical location (`location`)
  - Its IP address (`ipaddress`)
  - The current timestamp (`deleted_at`)
  - The database user who performed the deletion (`deleted_by`)

  This data is stored in the `server_deletion_log` table to maintain an audit trail. This mechanism ensures accountability and supports infrastructure monitoring by tracking deleted records, which can be   essential for diagnosing issues or maintaining compliance with internal policies.

  The function uses `OLD` to reference the deleted row and inserts the composed information into the log table. It returns `OLD` to complete the trigger operation successfully.
